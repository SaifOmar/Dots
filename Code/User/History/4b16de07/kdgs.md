look at the payment process, I have been implemeting a payment where you don't need to buy credits you just make the payment on the order directly,
the application works in this way, 
a user places an order, the order is created with a pending status, then a delivery man can take the order,
currently the delivery man can use the take_order() endpoint to take the order, but for now it only works with credist, you can look how credist work in the clients views, in create_payment_intent() function and confirm_payment() function, those add credits that can be used to take orders, but I want to also add more this so that the delivery man can take orders directly without credits, so I want you to add change endpoint take_order() that will work in this way:
1. the delivery just select the order he wants to take and he just buys it directly with stripe, so you will need to create a payment intent for the order amount, and confirm the payment with stripe.
